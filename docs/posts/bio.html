                    <h4>I’m not a huge fan of unsolicited advice, overthinking, defeatism, or mayonnaise. I wouldn’t have mentioned it if it wasn’t important.</h4>
<p>I have owned computers since the age of seven, played <a title="Valse" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204111/http://youtu.be/ttu9XJnsZfc" target="_blank">piano</a> since before I can remember, and been <a title="Knife" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204111/http://www.keithratner.com/knife/" target="_blank">writing</a>, <a title="Trans-Dimensional Voyager" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204111/http://www.tumblr.com/blog/transdimensionalvoyager" target="_blank">drawing</a>, and creating in one form or another for my entire life.</p>
<p>An alumnus of the original <a title="Performing Arts High School" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204111/http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=204479723104&amp;set=t.564013104&amp;type=3&amp;theater" target="_blank">High School of Performing Arts</a> in New York City, I played Carnegie Recital Hall when I was twelve, having started formal piano lessons at the age of six. I was the kid who routinely disappointed my parents’ party guests by playing Brahms and Rachmaninoff when they were hoping for Billy Joel and Barry Manilow. Lacking the discipline to compete in a conservatory environment, I opted to grow my hair, play in rock bands and attend Hunter College, majoring in something that came naturally to me: creative writing. I confess to having had fantasies of being the coolest English professor imaginable, sort of like the main character in “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204111/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185014/" target="_blank" title="Wonder Boys">Wonder Boys</a>.”</p>
<p>I spent two semesters as a teacher’s assistant for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204111/http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/administration/eija-ayravainen" target="_blank" title="Eija Ayravainen">my favorite professor of all time</a>, graduated in 1990, then moved on to tutoring part time at Queensborough Community College Writing Center.</p>
<p>In 1992, I picked up and moved to San Francisco, where I embarked upon my corporate career. This led to a string of positions at organizations ranging from non-profits to global financial institutions. Somehow, I’ve managed to be the go-to guy for everything graphics-related, though I lack any “formal” visual design training. My father, however, was a professional advertising artist. Perhaps there is a correlation.</p>
<p>After a brief ten-year stint in New York as Director of Corporate Communications at a healthcare organization which ended unceremoniously via Blackberry, I returned to the West Coast and, ironically, to the non-profit sector, as Design and Information Technology Manager for <a title="BayBio" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204111/http://www.baybio.org/" target="_blank">BayBio</a>, a biotechnology trade association in South San Francisco, before joining <a title="Quaddra Software" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204111/http://www.quaddra-sw.com/" target="_blank">Quaddra Software</a>, a San Jose startup building a very cool storage&nbsp;analytics and management tool to make sense of unstructured data and enable hybrid cloud scenarios.</p>
<p>I’ve devoted some time over the past couple of years to the <a title="Lean Startup Circle" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204111/http://blog.leanstartupcircle.com/" target="_blank">Lean Startup Circle</a>,&nbsp;a group dedicated to&nbsp;<em>applying lean startup thinking</em>&nbsp;and<em>&nbsp;building</em>&nbsp;<em>lean startup leadership.</em> If you’re interested in latest trends and schools of thought within the startup community, it might behoove you to grab yourself a copy of Eric Ries’ <a title="The Lean Startup by Eric Ries" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204111/http://theleanstartup.com/" target="_blank">The Lean Startup</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been known to get some more of my thrills as an instructor for <a title="AcademyX" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204111/http://www.academyx.com/" target="_blank">AcademyX</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Visit Sterling Ledet and Associates" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204111/http://www.ledet.com/" target="_blank">Sterling Ledet and Associates</a>, and <a title="Future Media Concepts" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204111/http://www.fmctraining.com/" target="_blank">Future Media Concepts</a> teaching Adobe software, maybe even WordPress on a good day. Feel free to contact me if you need a crash course, but be forwarned: you may be subjected to information overload. I’ll try to take it easy on you.</p>
<p>I also love to cook. White Clam Sauce happens to be one of my specialties…</p>
