<p>I’ve built an Illustrator file with artboards named and sized to accommodate all the major social media sites: LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram and YouTube.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317173811/http://www.keithratner.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/03/social-media-profile-image-template.ai">Download the Illustrator file here.</a></p>
<p>Multiple artboards means Illustrator is my tool of choice for any and all branding campaigns, enabling management of all digital assets inside of one file. Go check out <a title="Adobe Illustrator will Iron Your Shirt" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317173811/http://www.keithratner.com/adobe-illustrator-will-iron-your-shirt/">my post from a couple of years ago</a> and be sure to download Matthew Ericson’s script which exports layers and artboards to individual PNG files while you’re at it. His script has given me many years of my life back. Hopefully, this will do the same for you. Cheers!</p>
