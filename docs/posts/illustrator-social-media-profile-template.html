        <section class="entry-summary"><h2>jQuery UI Dialogs Remain Visible by Default when Clicking Outside</h2>
<p>Users may expect that modal dialogs will close when they click outside the dialog region. This behavior is not built in to the jQuery UI Dialog widget. Until such time as this gets implemented in the jQuery UI framework, a few lines of jQuery is all it takes to implement this behavior.</p>
<h2>The Quick Nuts and Bolts</h2>
<p>When initializing your dialog, specify the dialogClass option and add the <strong>clickoncloseoutside</strong>* class, thus ensuring that dialogs will not close when clicking outside, maintaining their default behavior. (Note that this will work with non-modal dialogs, though I can’t think of a use case where non-modals would be expected to close when the user clicks outside.):</p>
<pre>$("#myDialog").dialog({
  autoOpen: false,
  buttons: [
    { text: "OK", click: function() { $( this ).dialog( "close" ); } }
  ],
  dialogClass: "<strong>clickoncloseoutside</strong>",
  modal: true,
  title: "My Dialog",
});</pre>
<p>In keeping with the “Write Less, Do More” jQuery philosophy, with a couple of lines of code, add a click handler to the full window overlay. Within the handler, locate and close all open modal dialogs that have been assigned the <strong>clickoncloseoutside</strong> class:</p>
<pre>$("body")
  .on("click", "div.ui-widget-overlay:visible", function() {
    $(".ui-dialog.<strong>clickoncloseoutside</strong>:visible").find(".ui-dialog-content").dialog("close");
  });</pre>
<p><em>*Note that clickoncloseoutside is an arbitrary class name.</em></p>

<p>I’ve built an Illustrator file with artboards named and sized to accommodate all the major social media sites: LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram and YouTube.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://www.keithratner.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/03/social-media-profile-image-template.ai">Download the Illustrator file here.</a></p>
<p>Multiple artboards means Illustrator is my tool of choice for any and all branding campaigns, enabling management of all digital assets inside of one file. Go check out <a title="Adobe Illustrator will Iron Your Shirt" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://www.keithratner.com/adobe-illustrator-will-iron-your-shirt/">my post from a couple of years ago</a> and be sure to download Matthew Ericson’s script which exports layers and artboards to individual PNG files while you’re at it. His script has given me many years of my life back. Hopefully, this will do the same for you. Cheers!</p>

For anything more elaborate, such as incorporating custom fields into your feeds, you can build custom feeds.</span></p>
<h2>Build Your RSS Feed in WordPress</h2>
<p>There are a few steps involved, so be forewarned: there will be some PHP coding involved. The steps are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build a custom page template for your feed</li>
<li>Choose a category for your feed</li>
<li>Create a new page using the custom category and page template</li>
<li>Test the feed using a feed validator</li>
<li>Debug if necessary</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information, see <a title="Creating Your Own Page Templates" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages#Creating_Your_Own_Page_Templates" target="_blank">Creating Your Own Page Templates</a>.</p>
<h3>Creating the Custom Page Template</h3>
<p>You’ll start off creating a new PHP file in your template directory. <em>(I’m a big fan of <a title="WordPress Child Themes" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes" target="_blank">child themes</a> myself, which is another discussion.)</em> My preference is to use naming conventions; in this case, name your file <strong>template-page-custom-category-rss.php</strong>. This should help you keep files organized in your main (child) template folder. The PHP file should start out with this:</p>
<p>&lt;?php<br>
/**<br>
* Template Name: Your Custom RSS Feed<br>
*/</p>
<p>?&gt;</p>
<p>We’ll come back to the template file after setting up our testing environment.</p>
<p>Choosing a Category for Your Feed</p>
<p>The idea is to only make posts from a particular category available to the feed. For this exercise, we’ll create a custom category named <strong>Custom Category</strong>. Make sure the slug is <strong>custom-category</strong> (WordPress should generate this for you, but you can edit the slug yourself if necessary).</p>
<h3>Creating the RSS Page, Selecting the Category and Assigning the Template</h3>
<p>Add a new page. The title of the page is not that important, though I recommend you choose something that will help you distinguish and find it amongst all of your other pages. The important thing here is to set your permalink. In this case, let’s specify <strong>custom-category-rss</strong>. <em>You will want to customize this.</em></p>
<p>[screenshot of permalink admin]</p>
<p>Choose the <strong>Custom Category</strong> from the <strong>Categories</strong> meta box.</p>
<p>Assign the new <strong>Your Custom RSS Feed</strong> template to the page. It should now be available in the <strong>Template</strong> drop-down list within the <strong>Page Attributes</strong> meta box.</p>
<p>Publish your page. Go ahead and view it to make sure it displays an empty page. Take note of the URL in the address bar. This will be the URL of your feed.</p>
<h3>Building the Feed Framework</h3>
<p>The feed itself is an XML file whose root node is <strong>&lt;rss&gt;</strong> with a child <strong>&lt;channel&gt;</strong> node. Inside the <strong>&lt;channel&gt;</strong> node are <strong>&lt;item&gt;</strong> nodes which represent each news item. <em>For further information, you can explore the RSS 2.0 Specification <a title="RSS 2.0 Specification" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Before diving into the PHP code, we’ll build out the basic XML file. First, add this line at the end of the PHP file, just before the final PHP delimiter (“?&gt;”):</p>
<p>echo “&lt;?xml version=’1.0′ encoding=’UTF-8′?&gt;n”;</p>
<p><em>Note: If we add this outside of the PHP delimiters, the “&lt;?” syntax will confuse the interpreter and throw an error.</em></p>
<p>Your <strong>template-page-custom-category-rss.php</strong>&nbsp;file should now look like this:</p>
<p>&lt;?php<br>
/**<br>
* Template Name: Your Custom RSS Feed<br>
*/</p>
<p>echo “&lt;?xml version=’1.0′ encoding=’UTF-8′?&gt;n”;</p>
<p>?&gt;</p>
<p>We’ll add the rest of the XML outside of the PHP delimiters. <em>We will also be adding a PHP function to handle date formatting. More information on this is available <a title="RFC2822 Date Formatting" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://feedvalidator.org/docs/error/InvalidRFC2822Date.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</em> &nbsp;Your&nbsp;<strong>template-page-custom-category-rss.php</strong>&nbsp;file should now look like this:</p>
<p>&lt;?php<br>
/**<br>
* Template Name: Your Custom RSS Feed<br>
*/</p>
<p>function rfcDate( $s ) {<br>
//return date(DATE_RFC822, strtotime(get_the_date()));<br>
return date(DATE_RFC822,strtotime($s));<br>
}</p>
<p>echo “&lt;?xml version=’1.0′ encoding=’UTF-8′?&gt;n”;</p>

<h3>Populating the Feed</h3>
<p>We’ll be instantiating a new <a title="WP_Query Class" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query" target="_blank">WP_Query</a> object, passing it some parameters, mainly telling it to return all the posts from the <strong>custom-category</strong>, then using <a title="WordPress: The Loop" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop" target="_blank">The Loop</a> to iterate through each post so we can replace the placeholders with dynamic data.</p>
<p>We’ll insert PHP code before the <strong>&lt;item&gt;</strong> node to instantiate the object and start the loop, then we’ll close the loop after the <strong>&lt;item&gt;</strong> node. We’ll replace the placeholders with snippets of PHP code to display the dynamic data.</p>
<p>The final <strong>template-page-custom-category-rss.php</strong>&nbsp;file should look like this:</p>
<p>&lt;?php<br>

&lt;/item&gt;</p>
<p>In this case, we used the <a title="wp-types Plugin" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://wp-types.com/home/types-manage-post-types-taxonomy-and-custom-fields/" target="_blank"><strong>wp-types</strong></a> plugin to manage our custom fields, which adds a <strong>wpcf-</strong> prefix to its custom field names within the WordPress database. <a title="Advanced Custom Fields for WordPress" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Advanced Custom Fields</strong></a> is another great plugin for managing custom fields, which also adds a prefix. Check corresponding documentation for field names. Custom fields can be accessed using the <a title="WordPress: get_post_meta Function" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_post_meta" target="_blank"><strong>get_post_meta</strong></a> function. In our case, we use that function to assign the custom fields to a variable here:</p>
<p>$meta_values = <span style="color: #ff6600">get_post_meta</span>($post_id);</p>
<p>We’re sorting the posts in ascending order using the custom field, then populating the <strong>&lt;pubDate&gt;</strong> node with the values from the custom field. Note that out of the box, <strong>&lt;pubDate&gt;</strong> is typically populated with the Published Date. In this case, we want to focus on a date value that’s contained in a custom field rather than when the post was published.</p>

<p>Google Chrome is my favorite browser, as evidenced by the proliferation of <a title="Chrome Extensions (Chrome Web Store)" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions" target="_blank">extensions</a> I have loaded up. I’ve reached the point where I should probably consider a little housecleaning and uninstall those least used, though I fear that I’ll have a pressing need for that deleted extension after the fact. It can happen. Nevertheless, the sheer productivity gains I’ve realized with this collection overall are, quite simply, <em>insane</em> (or at least they may appear that way to the casual observer).</p>
<h2>Chrome Extensions in Order of Usefulness. To Me. Sort of.</h2>

Perhaps the question is, <em><strong>“Why do we need groupware?”</strong></em></p>
<p>The primary groupware business assumptions are that people need it and that they would be willing to integrate <em><strong>another piece of software</strong></em> into their individual workflows. Let’s look at an assumption along with a possible user persona and scenario:</p>
<h2>Groupware assumes people will add software to their workflow.</h2>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-393" title="Communication" alt="Communication" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413im_/http://www.rationalplayground.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/3/files/2012/07/antenna.png" width="300" height="440">Joe Media has a killer to-do list app that he uses. It’s sort of like Evernote, but it integrates actionable, time-based items that trigger force feedback on his iPhone when he marks them as ‘Done,’ a sensation he now equates with the taste of the best raw oyster he ever had. <em>Joe is not giving up that app.</em> The app also sends e-mail reminders. Joe uses Outlook at work, albeit a bit reluctantly, since he’s no big fan of Microsoft, but he considers it a necessary evil in his workplace, particularly since his organization does business with other businesses who also tend to use Outlook. Scheduling meetings is just much easier that way with people trading meeting invites. They’re not ditching Outlook any time soon.</p>
<p>Joe’s early-adopter-to-a-fault I.T. buddy at work keeps pushing for some kind of group collaboration project management Kanban-style social media-integrated tool to assist their team with meeting deadlines. They tried Yammer for about three minutes once because his friend heard they were well funded, after a customer mentioned that it would be really cool if he could he could chat with other meeting attendees in advance to arrange things like hikes, bike rides, lunches. That was eight months ago. There was no traction.</p>
<p>Joe and the I.T guy constantly bemoan everyone else’s inability to stick to processes, many of which don’t exist in any documented fashion but should, in their eyes, be “Common Sense.” Their big pain point is in communicating deadlines.</p>

<p>We all have e-mail, though by default <a title="Why email continues to be a poor project management tool" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://mcgeesmusings.net/2006/10/08/why-email-continues-to-be-a-poor-project-management-tool/" target="_blank">e-mail is far from ideal for project management</a>. For instant communication, the telephone used to be ideal, but phone calls are time consuming and, thanks to the variety of tools available now, <a title="The Phone is Dead" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/20/death-of-the-phone-call" target="_blank">the telephone is all but history</a>. Social media services are tribal in nature, thus there tend to be rabid followers for Facebook, Twitter and Google+ (which is decidedly NOT a ghost town, you naysayers), though rarely the twain shall meet. Regardless of the lack of intersection, the messaging infrastructure is already built many times over, but e-mail is the common thread.</p>
<p>Adjusting e-mail to accommodate project management methodologies has been discussed for years, with add-ons developed for Outlook catering to fans of <a title="Getting Things Done (Wikipedia)" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done" target="_blank">GTD</a> and the like. I’ve been using the free version of <a title="ActiveInbox" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://www.activeinboxhq.com/" target="_blank">ActiveInbox</a> for Gmail. There is a lot of potential there.</p>
<p>The idea is to migrate the important data out of individual e-mails into actionable items with visual cues, calendar integration, and customizable reminders.</p>
<h3><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.keithratner.com/groupware-has-it-wrong/&amp;text=E-Mail+Is+Intensely+Personal&amp;via=TriKro&amp;related=TriKro" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to tweet this." target="_blank" class="tweetherder">E-Mail Is Intensely Personal</a></h3>
<p>Content of e-mail can certainly be personal, not to mention incriminating, but e-mail itself has been woven into the fabric of our society, regardless of the rich ecosystems of apps that have been developed around mobile devices. E-mail is ubiquitous. E-mail is a noun and a verb. People use e-mail for project management whether or not they admit it. It may not be the primary tool for more evolved organizations, but it is highly integrated into processes nonetheless. It cannot be avoided, as everyone else uses it. The popularity of such systems as Getting Things Done is a testament to people’s need for something more, but perhaps a replacement for e-mail is not what we’re all asking for.</p>
<p>Successful collaboration software needs to integrate with existing e-mail along with other popular time management methodologies. It needs to be familiar, with a virtually nonexistent learning curve.</p>

If we agree that we’re striving to contribute to society and improve upon the human condition, we might want to be mindful of the language we use in the process.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of quotes to support my position. I always welcome any feedback to the contrary, all the while making no claims whatsoever that I am immune to cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-299" title="Nixon" alt="Nixon" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413im_/http://www.rationalplayground.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/3/files/2012/06/nixon.png" width="610" height="440"></p>
<blockquote><p>So you are <strong>lean and mean</strong> and resourceful and you continue to walk on the edge of the precipice because over the years you have become fascinated by how close you can walk without losing your balance.”&nbsp;<em>Richard Milhous Nixon</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These sounds like the words of someone with a death wish. Without question:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.keithratner.com/lean-and-mean/&amp;text=Risk+is+a+necessary+component+of+every+entrepreneurial+endeavor.&amp;via=TriKro&amp;related=TriKro" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to tweet this." target="_blank" class="tweetherder">Risk is a necessary component of every entrepreneurial endeavor.</a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, pathological ideations in a group setting can lead to the ruin of many lives. That’s the reality. I’ll spare you the history lesson.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-302" title="Reverend Friendly" alt="Reverend Friendly" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413im_/http://www.rationalplayground.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/3/files/2012/06/rev-friendly.png" width="610" height="440"></p>
<blockquote><p>In America, we hurry–which is well; but when the day’s work is done, we go on thinking of losses and gains, we plan for the morrow, we even carry our business cares to bed with us…we burn up our energies with these excitements, and either die early or drop into a <strong>lean and mean</strong> old age at a time of life which they call a man’s prime in Europe…What a robust people, what a nation of thinkers we might be, if we would only lay ourselves on the shelf occasionally and renew our edges!” <em>Mark Twain, The Innocents Abroad</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anger can be a great motivator. Over time, it will wear you down, if it doesn’t kill you outright. In the meantime, it might turn you into a miserable bastard no one else wants to be around or worse, foster an angry mob.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-307" title="Hitler Youth" alt="Hitler Youth" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413im_/http://www.rationalplayground.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/3/files/2012/06/hitler-youth.png" width="610" height="440"></p>
<blockquote><p>A German boy must be <strong>lean and mean</strong>, quick like a greyhound, tough as leather, and hard as Krupp steel. He must learn self-denial, to endure reproaches and injustice, to be reliable, silent, obedient, and loyal.”&nbsp;<em>Motto of the Hitler Youth</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not consider myself a Pacifist, nor do I advocate rolling over in the face of adversity. Self defense is our prerogative. Rather, I caution against exclusionary, adversarial tactics.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s worth noting that both Stages Three and Four require an adversary. When we work with people and groups, people in Stage Three groups will say, ‘I’m great because I sold more last quarter than anyone’ or ‘I just bought a huge house.’ They begin to notice that these statements are all comparative, netting out to ‘I’m better than others.’ At Stage Four, people will say, ‘We’re great because our team is winning’ or ‘We have the best people.’ Again, this language system implies ‘We’re better than them.’ At Three, the enemy is other individuals. At Four, it’s another group, or a company, or even an industry. Only at Stage Five does the need for an enemy go away.” <em>Dave Logan and John King, <a title="Tribal Leadership" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://www.triballeadership.net/" target="_blank">Tribal Leadership</a></em></p>

<p>Logan and King are referring to the Five Tribal Stages, the fifth of which is embodied by altruism, a focus on values, a ‘noble cause.’ At this stage, the need for adversaries vanishes. After all, we’re in this to make the world a better place, together. Aren’t we?</p>

They are startup idea machines. We all are, really, until we start growing up and listening to the rest of the world talking about how uncreative they are. The drive to create is at increasing odds with the longing to fit in, thus we settle in and cease innovating. That’s the thing to do, if you’re “normal.”</p>
<p>Some of us (I choose to think of us as “the fortunate ones”) never really grow up. This childlike creativity carries with it the requisite full range of emotions and behaviors, notably self-centeredness, delusions of grandeur, possessiveness, as well as gregariousness.</p>

<h2>The Rock Band Startup Metaphor</h2>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-273" title="Ready to Conquer the World" alt="Ready to Conquer the World" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413im_/http://www.rationalplayground.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/3/files/2012/06/10719_100471219977350_6525980_n-300x225.jpeg" width="300" height="225">Putting together a rock band means assembling a group of people you’re going to be spending a lot of time with, chasing your dreams, adjusting your course, “pivoting,” for better or worse. You can bet there is going to be quite a bit of “worse.”</p>
<p>My own musical career case study involved witnessing (and, admittedly, playing an active role in) bands throwing away any chance of success by allowing their emotions to get in the way. Some great music was made amidst the chaos of flying fists, exchanged romantic interests, and shifting alliances, but ultimately, attention spans were short, much like those of Kindergarten classes. Ultimately, bands broke up because we weren’t emotionally prepared to stick it out through the rough times. Indeed, this is why most relationships end.</p>
<h2>Kindergarten is the Only Education You’ll Ever Need</h2>
<p>If you’ve never volunteered in a Kindergarten, give it a shot. There’s a crash course in human behavior, lessons you may have forgotten over the years. Go get a refresher.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.keithratner.com/on-rock-bands-kindergarten-and-startups/&amp;text=Kindergarten+students+can+be+remarkably+focused+when+there+is+a+clear+task+at+hand.&amp;via=TriKro&amp;related=TriKro" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to tweet this." target="_blank" class="tweetherder">Kindergarten students can be remarkably focused when there is a clear task at hand.</a></p>
<p>They’ll even work together, happily, and share in the joy of completing things, before moving onto the next endeavor.</p>
<h2>Who Do You Want to Spend Nearly All of Your Time With?</h2>
<p>There needs to be an emotional contract amongst co-founders. Choose wisely. You will be sharing some trials and tribulations. Your initial ideas are merely seeds. The real question is whether you can get along through thick and thin, inspire each other, maintain some optimism and above all, not give up – unless you’re really not meant to be together. Avoid the initial impulse to break up. Don’t do what my bands did. There were at least a couple of them that may have amounted to something if only they didn’t get carried away and make rash decisions.</p>
<p>Twenty years later, I still speak to my old band mates. With few exceptions, we regret those decisions to this day, all of us left wondering what might have been.</p>

<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-210" title="Gestalt" alt="Gestalt" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413im_/http://www.rationalplayground.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/3/files/2012/05/Abstract3.gif" width="194" height="222"></p>
<h2>Just a Doodler</h2>
<p>Gestalt Ingenieur translates to Shape or Form Engineer; though I would not profess to being an engineer, <strong>I like the inclusive nature of this term</strong>. Besides, it sounds exotic. I’ve always been uncomfortable referring to myself as a designer, despite having held the title formally on numerous occasions. Thanks to the likes of Rams, Ive, Apple and many others, perhaps design is getting some proper recognition these days. Nevertheless, my father was, in my view, the ‘Real Deal.’ He could illustrate, by hand. He was trained. Me, I’m a doodler, albeit a fairly accomplished one, especially if you count the fact that a couple of my comic strips were published (full disclosure: it was a college publication circa 1990, and the editor was one of my closest friends).</p>
<p>Having been around and owned computers for virtually my entire life, I’ve never shied away from getting my hands dirty when it comes to coding, or scripting, or programming. The Graduate Supervisor at San Jose State University, where I’m pursuing my Masters in Computer Science, asked, “So you think you can code?”</p>
<h2>Gestalt Ingenieur, What?</h2>
<p>I do code. I wouldn’t call myself a programmer any more than I would a designer, but the reality is programming is a large part of what I do, but it’s all a means to an end, whatever it takes to accomplish the puzzle of the day. These puzzles, for me, tend to be usability-related. Sometimes, they’re people-related. All the jQuery in the world can’t solve those kinds if problems. In those situations, pretending to be a sea of tranquility is sometimes the best bet. In short:</p>

I recently mentioned <a title="Lean UX" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://www.uie.com/articles/lean_ux" target="_blank">Lean UX</a> to someone and they perked up: “What can you tell me about that?”</p>
<p>I can tell you that I owe my career as a graphics-visual-ui-ux-whatever-you-feel-like-calling-it-guy to this methodology, if you even can call it a methodology. I was lean before it was a trend – and I’m not just referring to my <a title="Body Mass Index" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index" target="_blank">BMI</a>. I’ve held graphic design positions (regardless of what the actual <em><strong>titles</strong></em> were) at all kinds of organizations huge and small for decades, yet I still have a hard time referring to myself as a graphic designer. My late father was one of the few <em><strong>real</strong></em> graphic designers I’ve ever known. I should be so lucky to have but a fraction of his raw talent. At least, I am assuming he had raw talent, although he did actually <a title="School of Visual Arts" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://www.sva.edu/" target="_blank">go to school for it</a>. Nevertheless, I can hold my own. The fact that I know the de facto software inside and out may help, though that <em><strong>should</strong></em> be expected of anyone in this field. However, when it comes time for a design meeting, no one cares about what software you use or how clever you are while using it. It’s all about the product.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://skillzdesign.com/folio/draws/vintage-disembodied-doodle.png" class="grouped_elements" rel="tc-fancybox-group115" target="_blank" title="Disembodied Head"><img class="alignright" title="Disembodied Head" alt="Disembodied Head" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413im_/http://skillzdesign.com/folio/draws/vintage-disembodied-doodle.png" width="320" height="455"></a>The idea is simply to get something in front of the stakeholders as early as possible. This is the product. It will be, by definition, imperfect, raw, and in need of revision. Unless you work in a vacuum, this has to happen. Ideally, there will be a few (three is a great number, never less than three) versions to review. Listen to the comments. Absorb all input. Get over yourself.</p>
<p>Keep iterating. Incorporate suggestions, revisions, diatribes, everything is fair game. Do not stop iterating until the product is shipped, printed, published, posted, tweeted, and of course,&nbsp;<a title="Pinstagram" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://www.pinstagram.co/" target="_blank">Pintstagrammed</a>. After that, keep iterating, unless it’s a one-off project, in which case iterating means using all this knowledge thus far to help streamline future projects and meetings with this cast of characters who have entrusted you with their naked souls.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.keithratner.com/draw/&amp;text=Whenever+possible%2C+draw.+&amp;via=TriKro&amp;related=TriKro" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to tweet this." target="_blank" class="tweetherder">Whenever possible, draw. </a></p>
<p>This falls under the “I should take my own advice” category, as my own manual drawing has taken a back seat to the computerized variety for far too many years.&nbsp;Why draw? If a picture is worth a thousand words, a lousy picture could become a cacophony of insults. Without a doubt, this is why most people refuse to draw in the first place. Again, get over yourself. I’ve been told that I can, in fact, draw. We all can. We can all make pictures using whatever tools happen to be around. I developed whatever abilities I have over time, with practice. Pictures are far more efficient than words, and drawing by hand can still be far more efficient than using a device. There are finally some electronic tools these days which can replace pen(cil) and paper, but they cost a lot more money. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.keithratner.com/draw/&amp;text=Until+tablets+are+everywhere%2C+lo-tech+can+prevail.&amp;via=TriKro&amp;related=TriKro" rel="nofollow" title="Click here to tweet this." target="_blank" class="tweetherder">Until tablets are everywhere, lo-tech can prevail.</a></p>
<p>After all this reading, I’m feeling like going back to the drawing board. That’s right, I said it. Enough with the overengineering already. Time to put pen or pencil or marker or blood to paper. Kill some trees – as long as the paper’s recycled. Maybe notes from my next design meeting will have no words at all. Maybe there won’t even be wifi. Back to basics, keep it simple, return to the roots. Feel free to insert some Buddhist-sounding cliché here.</p>

I’ve been on Google+ for a while, but I’ve recently ‘rediscovered’ it, thanks in no small part to Guy Kawasaki’s <a title="What the Plus" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://www.guykawasaki.com/what-the-plus/" target="_blank">What the Plus</a>. It’s a quick read, highly recommended for anyone with any designs on becoming a ‘power user.’ If you are in any way interested in social marketing, content curation, or any of the buzzwords of late, here’s some unsolicited advice: that should be you.</p>
<p>The keys to the kingdom, so to speak, lie with Shared Circles, which is, as of this writing, a relatively new feature, but invaluable – and, in my opinion, a feature which frankly blows Facebook out of the water. Mind you, I still use Facebook. As much as the two services are in direct competition with one another, I actually believe they can coexist, at least for a while. They’re going to have to, at least in my world, while our Facebook friends continue to ridicule and diminish the very concept of Google+.</p>
<p>I would love to see a <a title="Sentiment Analysis (Wikipedia)" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319230413/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis" target="_blank">sentiment analysis</a> of Facebook users’ commentary regarding Google+ vs. their sentiments about Facebook itself, particularly when Facebook changes its interface. I suspect that the knee jerk reactions tend to come from the same folks.</p>
